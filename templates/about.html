            <h2>What Is A Primain©?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">In simple words, Primain© is the easiest possible version of your crypto wallet’s address. Imagine going from this: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa to ‘mywallet’ and sharing it easily with your friends via swupelpms.org/$mywallet! We help convert your wallet addresses into a simple, easy-to-remember, and easy-to-share format. It is simply an ‘alias’ for your wallet address. Isn’t that simple?</p>
        </li>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h2>How Can I Get Myself A Primain©?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">That’s easy! Simply go to <a href="https://swupelpms.org/primains">swupelpms.org/primains</a> and follow the simple step-by-step instructions you see there.</p>
        </li>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h2>Is Getting A Primain© Safe?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Imagine a Primain© as your email ID. A Primain©, as shared above, is just an easy-to-remember and easy-to-share wallet address, just like an email ID. We don’t come in contact with your digital assets at any point, nor do we know how many billions worth of coins you hold in your wallet. We are just helping you create an alias for your wallet address. That’s it.</p>
        </li>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h2>How Do You Ensure That My Wallet Won’t Be Hacked?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">As shared above, we never come in contact with your digital assets, nor do we know what assets are held in any wallet. When creating a Primain©, a user has to authenticate their wallet with their wallet’s private key, proving that they own the wallet address. Once that is done, we verify the key with the wallet provider (e.g., Metamask), and voila! The Primain© is created and is the only one of its kind in the world!</p>
        </li>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h2>Will A Primain© Keep My Digital Assets Safe?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">We don’t provide security for your digital assets. We only provide an easy-to-remember and easy-to-share wallet address instead of the conventional crypto addresses you may know.</p>
        </li>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h2>Can I Make Any Custom Primain© That Comes To My Mind?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">You can be as creative as you wish, or you can let the system create a Primain© for you! The pricing for various customization levels can be found at <a href="https://swupelpms.org/primains/pricing">swupelpms.org/primains/pricing</a>. Go get creative!</p>
